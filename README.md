# A* pathfinding

## What it is

A* (A star) algorithm is one of path-finding algorithms often used in e.g. real time strategy games. It's high performance and accurate, so it guarantees the shortest path will always be found (if it exists).

## About the implementation

The goal of this projects is tu visualise how A* pathfinding works. A user can set start / finish points, draw obstacles on the map and see how the algorithm will find the optimal path.

It's possible to see the details of the process on various speed options.

## Technologies

The algorithm has been implemented in Javascript.

To build the user interface HTML, CSS and jQuery has been used.
